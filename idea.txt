lichess but for cf 

- User connection system 
- Problem showing system 
- Problem submission system 
- Rating system 



Basic workflow in simple terms 

A user joins the platform 
    - Connect via CF / Gmail 
    - Play random matches 
    - Play against a human player of +/- same rating 

Everything same except for chess we have cf problems 



---
2 players in a match 
i see one of them has submitted first 
i can check their submission using  https://codeforces.com/api/user.status?handle=<HANDLE>
and then update their ratings and match is done 


i dont think we can do this randomly 

when player enters his handle then we emit 'on join' and add him to the queue or match 
with other 



first we do socketio 
then we do redis 
then we do rating based matching 


ok first we have to do the rating and then if we want to we will add redis 

checking solutions is not possible for now
