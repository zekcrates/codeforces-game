# CODEFORCES GAME 

The User will be able to play based on their rating just like chess. 

Each player will have some base rating(from cf) and playing and winning more matches against others will 
increase their rating. 

We use the ELO rating system same as the chess. 


We will use the CODEFORCES PUBLIC API!!!
This should be fun :)
